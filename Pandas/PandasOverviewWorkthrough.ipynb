    "- TWO indexing-selecting-assigning\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "Selecting specific values of a pandas DataFrame or Series to work on is an implicit step in almost any data operation you'll run, so one of the first things you need to learn in working with data in Python is how to go about selecting the data points relevant to you quickly and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native accessors\n",
    "Native Python objects provide good ways of indexing data. Pandas carries all of these over, which helps make it easy to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this DataFrame: >>>  129971 rows × 13 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can access the property of an object by accessing it as an attribute. A book object, for example, might have a title property, which we can access by calling book.title. Columns in a pandas DataFrame work in much the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence to access the country property of reviews we can use:\n",
    "reviews.country\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a Python dictionary, we can access its values using the indexing ([]) operator. We can do the same with columns in a DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "reviews['country']\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the two ways of selecting a specific Series out of a DataFrame. Neither of them is more or less syntactically valid than the other, but the indexing operator [] does have the advantage that it can handle column names with reserved characters in them (e.g. if we had a country providence column, reviews.country providence wouldn't work).\n",
    "\n",
    "Doesn't a pandas Series look kind of like a fancy dictionary? It pretty much is, so it's no surprise that, to drill down to a single specific value, we need only use the indexing operator [] once more:\n",
    "\n",
    "reviews['country'][0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing in pandas\n",
    "The indexing operator and attribute selection are nice because they work just like they do in the rest of the Python ecosystem. As a novice, this makes them easy to pick up and use. However, pandas has its own accessor operators, loc and iloc. For more advanced operations, these are the ones you're supposed to be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Index-based selection\n",
    "Pandas indexing works in one of two paradigms. The first is index-based selection: selecting data based on its numerical position in the data. iloc follows this paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select the first row of data in a DataFrame, we may use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "reviews.iloc[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Both loc and iloc are row-first, column-second. This is the opposite of what we do in native Python, which is column-first, row-second.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that it's marginally easier to retrieve rows, and marginally harder to get retrieve columns. To get a column with iloc, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "reviews.iloc[:, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On its own, the : operator, which also comes from native Python, means \"everything\". When combined with other selectors, however, it can be used to indicate a range of values. For example, to select the country column from just the first, second, and third row, we would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "reviews.iloc[:3, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, to select just the second and third entries, we would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "reviews.iloc[1:3, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Aslo possible to pass a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "reviews.iloc[[0, 1, 2], 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it's worth knowing that negative numbers can be used in selection. This will start counting forwards from the end of the values. So for example here are the last five elements of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "reviews.iloc[-5:]\n",
    "\n",
    "Label-based selection\n",
    "The second paradigm for attribute selection is the one followed by the loc operator: label-based selection. In this paradigm, it's the data index value, not its position, which matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to get the first entry in reviews, we would now do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "reviews.loc[0, 'country'] >>>>>>> returns Italy\n",

When we use iloc we treat the dataset like a big matrix (a list of lists), one that we have to index into by position. loc, by contrast, uses the information in the indices to do its work. Since your dataset usually has meaningful indices, it's usually easier to do things using loc instead. For example, here's one operation that's much easier using loc:\n",

If we have a DataFrame with index values Apples, ..., Potatoes, ..., and we want to select \"all the alphabetical fruit choices between Apples and Potatoes\", then it's a lot more convenient to index df.loc['Apples':'Potatoes'] than it is to index something like df.loc['Apples', 'Potatoet] (t coming after s in the alphabet).\n",

In data science we often have a need for creating new representations from existing data, or for transforming data from the format it is in now to the format that we want it to be in later. Maps are what handle this work, making them extremely important for getting your work done!\n",

    "Pandas provides many common mapping operations as built-ins. For example, here's a faster way of remeaning our points column:\n",

    "\n",
    "You can think of each group we generate as being a slice of our DataFrame containing only data with values that match.

For example, here's one way of selecting the name of the first wine reviewed from each winery in the dataset:\n",
